### Double Pole Skip (by K1ngGr33n & AprilShade) 
Instead of drifting around the turns, use either CJs, Pole Jumps, or off-road tricks to make it over faster. 

There currently isn't really a concise strat or combo of techs that we know of. There are multiple paths, and it's unknown which one is faster. Listed below are all of the possible paths. 

**Part 1:**

1. CJ into the Pole
2. Don't CJ and just drive around

**Part 2:**

1. CJ into the Pole
2. CJ into the Wall
3. Off-road trick into the right wall and do a bunch of shenanigans 
4. Off-road trick into the further wall (currently impossible even with a boost) 
5. Don't do anything and just drive around

Upsides: Potentially saves needing to do 2 turns. 

Issues: Unconfirmed. There's so many paths we don't know what is faster for now.
