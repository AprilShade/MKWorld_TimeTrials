### Bloop Pole (by K1ngGr33n, confirmed by Bloop)
Trick off the 2 poles of the bridge to gain boost in the straight section.

1. Approach the first pole from the side, then quickly turn left a bit
2. Trick off the pole and get back on the bridge, then aim for the second pole. 
3. Approach the second pole from the side, then trick off the ledge behind it. Aim left to land back on the main road.

Upsides: Faster by a lot. 

Issues: Hard to do, especially at high speeds. Failure will kill the run as you might land in water.
