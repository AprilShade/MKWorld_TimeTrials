## CONFIRMED AND UTILISED

## CONFIRMED, NOT YET UTILISED
### Spiral Skip (by Lokilla)
Instead of drifting around the turn, ride the white wall from the inside to skip it entirely. 

0. Release a Right MT to set up the trick. 
1. Start a Left MT and release it on the corner of the boost panel. Trick off of the corner. 
2. Land on the second-to-last segment of the fence and trick right after falling off again.
3. The previous trick boost should carry you to the wall so you can ride it. 
4. Wall Jump twice in quick succession to stay on the wall and keep your speed. 
5. Reach the rail at the top, then Normal Jump off of it at the end. 

Upsides: COMPLETELY skips the drift around the spiral. Also chains into Pipe Jump Skip. 

Issues: INCREDIBLY hard. So far, the only one to ever pull it off is Lokilla herself. Many things can go wrong; Failed drifts, falling off the segment, a bad angle, lakitu, weird wall physics towards the end... You get the point. 



### Pipe Jump Skip (by K1ngGr33n) 
This is an alternative shroom spot, only to be used if Topperlecut somehow ends up working and being reasonably fast. Also chains from Spiral Skip. 

1. Start a CJ and aim towards the pipe. 
2. Shroom right before hitting the grass. 
3. Release your CJ early so you hit the pipe somewhere from the top. 
4. Maneuver towards the next pipe and jump off of it as well. 

Upsides: Chains from Spiral Skip. Also ridiculously easy to pull off once you know how it works.

Issues: Can't really think of any.

## CONFIRMED, BUT OBSOLETE

---
## NOT YET CONFIRMED
### Topperlecut (by Topperlecat)
Instead of using a shroom to cross the first turn, jump between poles and trees to make it over. 

1. 

Upsides: Saves a shroom for later usage. 

Issues: A bit finicky to pull off. Unfavorable positioning after landing.
