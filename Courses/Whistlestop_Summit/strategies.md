## CONFIRMED AND UTILISED
### Gap Jump (by b0ssguy)
Instead of driving around the long turn, CJ over the gap.

0. Start a Left Drift and do the normal shroom shortcut, then release Drift.
1. CJ over the gap. Try not to hit the wall.
2. Land on the other side.
3. Use a Rail Redirect to fix your angle.

Upsides: Can save up to an entire second on that turn.

Issues: The wall is a bit of a problem, as riding it gives a worse angle.
