(Note: If you want to submit your own strats, create an issue and select "Strategy Idea")

## CONFIRMED AND UTILISED
### Beginning Turn Skip (by grace)
Instead of going around the off-road, drive over it and trick back onto the track. 

1. Release a MT into the off-road. 
2. Trick off the ramp and Wall Ride. 
3. Ride off the top without Jumping, or grinding the rail. (The latter is apparently slower)

Upsides: Skips the turn. 

Issues: Misses 2 Coins at the start. 



### Kings Turn v2 (v1 by K1ngGr33n, v2 by Knightmare)
An upgraded version of the original Kings Turn, where instead of going down the route as normal, you perform a series of precise jumps on the left rail to take the turn sharper.

1. Get on the rail as far left as you can, and instantly jump off. 
2. Hold left in the air to land back on the rail, then do a Front Jump. 
3. Hold left in the air to land back on the rail. 
4. Front Jump off during the turn to land back on the bridge and get the coins. 

Upsides: Takes the turn sharper. This version also doesn't miss the 2 coins on the bridge. Probably easier than v1 because the Left Jump has been removed. 

Issues: Still inconsistent like v1, but not as much as before. 



### Water Path NISC
Instead of going around the turn or using a mushroom, do a Right CJ into it to skip most of the off-road. 

Yup. That's it. That's the strat. 

Upsides: Saves a shroom for later. Also chains into Shrine Skip. Super simple to do. Like I genuinely can't comprehend why we didn't think of this before. 

Issues: Idk, can't think of any. 



### Shrine Skip (by K1ngGr33n)
Instead of going around the shrine to charge a UMT, cross the shrine completely with a mushroom.

1. Start a Right Drift after landing in the water.
2. Aim to the right of the first pillar, and shroom through the crowd. Go as close to the pillar as you can to avoid Lakitu.
3. In the middle of the shrine, release your MT to redirect momentum and take the turn sharper.
4. Aim towards the left side of the final pillar.
5. After crossing the off-road, trick on the rock for an extra boost.
6. Start and release a Left CJ on the way up the stairs.

Upsides: Gets a trick boost at the end.

Issues: Only works in combination with Tarzan Skip or the Water Path NISC, as it saves less time than the normal shroom spot.

## CONFIRMED, NOT YET UTILISED
### Tarzan Skip (by Zaqua)
Instead of going into the slow water, wall jump, then jump along trees to preserve your speed. Also saves a shroom for Shrine Skip.

0. Wall Ride on the waterfall to gain speed, then approach the trees on the left. 
1. Perform a Wall Jump off the left of the ravine, then navigate to the hanging tree branch.
2. With precision, Pole Jump between the branches. 
3. Set up to land on a yellow barrier above the normal shroom shortcut.
4. Bounce off the barrier and realign towards the ravine exit. Right air tricks are recommended.

Upsides: Saves a shroom for use in Shrine Skip, and avoids going into the water.

Issues: VERY HARD. If someone ever gets this 3/3 Zaqua will probably cry tears of joy

## CONFIRMED, BUT OBSOLETE
### Kings Turn v1 (by K1ngGr33n)
Instead of going down the route as normal, perform a series of precise jumps on the left rail to take the turn sharper.

0. Perform 2 left tricks in quick succession (only if you approach from the right) 
1. Enter the rail as far left as you possibly can, then jump the moment you get on it. 
2. Hold left until you land, then do a normal jump and hold left again. 
3. Now cut the turn with a left jump, followed by a normal jump in quick succession. 
4. On lap 1, dodge the off-road to collect the 3 coins and get a faster UMT. On laps 2/3, graze the corner of the off-road to get a tighter drift.

Upsides: Takes the turn tighter and makes controlling your line at the end a bit easier.

Issues: This trick is HARD and inconsistent. You need a lot of precise and quick inputs to be even slightly faster. Also, you miss out on one coin on the bridge, but this loss is negligible.

## NOT YET CONFIRMED
### Ashe Line (By: Ashe Zo8)
Likely a strategy to combine with 2 other skips, where after taking a shortcut, you trick/CJ onto the left wall, and then the left railing to skip the left side of the turn.

1. Start a CJ after the original shroom turn.
2. Release the CJ at the same time as the lip of water goes down, aiming towards the wall.
3. Wall Ride up to take the turn tighter
4. (Maybe) trick out into the lower water section to have a turn into shrine 

Upsides: More boost, potentially a tighter line

Issues: Unsure if this is faster. ItÂ´s also hard to combine with the other skips, especially with Shrine Skip.
