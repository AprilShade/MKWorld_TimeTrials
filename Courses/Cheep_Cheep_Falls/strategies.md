### Kings Turn (by K1ngGr33n)
At the start of Cheep Cheep Falls, instead of going down the route as normal, perform a series of precise jumps on the left rail to take the turn sharper.

0. Perform 2 left tricks in quick succession (only if you approach from the right) 
1. Enter the rail as far left as you possibly can, then jump the moment you get on it. 
2. Hold left until you land, then do a normal jump and hold left again. 
3. Now cut the turn with a left jump, followed by a normal jump in quick succession. 
4. On lap 1, dodge the off-road to collect the 3 coins and get a faster UMT. On laps 2/3, graze the corner of the off-road to get a tighter drift. 

Issues: This trick is HARD and inconsistent. You need a lot of precise and quick inputs to be even slightly faster. Also, you miss out on one coin on the bridge, but this loss is negligible. 



### Tarzan Skip (by Zaqua)
Instead of going into the slow water, wall jump, then jump along trees to preserve your speed. Also saves a shroom for Temple Skip.

1. Perform a Wall Jump off the left of the ravine, then navigate to the hanging tree branch.
2. With precision, Pole Jump between the branches. 
3. Set up to land on a patch of grass above the normal shroom shortcut.
4. Drift through the grass and fall back down, facing the ravine exit. Do an air trick to help realign and for a boost.

Issues: VERY HARD. If someone ever gets this 3/3 Zaqua will probably cry tears of joy, and Calcaire will enter eternal depression

### Ashe Line
likely a strategy to combine with 2 other skips, where after taking a shortcut, you hop onto the left wall, and then the left railing to skip the left side of the turn, unsure if this is faster * and is hard to combine after the other skips.


### Shrine Skip [OUTDATED MAYBE]
Instead of going around the shrine to charge a UMT, cross the temple completely 

1. Start a Right Drift after landing in the water.
2. Shroom through the shrine at the end of the track, while holding full right.

Note: Only works in combination with Tarzan Skip. You probably need more Handling than what Bowser Reel Racer has.
