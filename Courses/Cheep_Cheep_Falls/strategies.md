### Kings Turn (by K1ngGr33n)
At the start of Cheep Cheep Falls, instead of going down the route as normal, perform a series of precise tricks on the left rail to take the turn sharper.

0. Perform 2 left tricks in quick succession (only if you approach from the right) 
1. Enter the rail as far left as you possibly can, then jump the moment you get on it. 
2. Hold left until you land, then do a normal jump and hold left again. 
3. Now cut the turn with a left jump, followed by a normal jump in quick succession. 
4. On lap 1, dodge the off-road to collect the 3 coins and get a faster UMT. On laps 2/3, graze the corner of the off-road to get a tighter drift. 

Issues: This trick is HARD and inconsistent. You need a lot of precise and quick inputs to be even slightly faster. Also, you miss out on one coin on the bridge, but this loss is negligible.
