### Vertical Wall Ride
This trick should in theory allow for a perfectly vertical Wall Ride to be performed in a corner. 

Current (assumed) instruction:

0. Find a corner with the fitting properties.
1. Drive at the corner while being perpendicular to one wall and almost parallel to the other.
2. Wall Ride on the perpendicular wall.
3. Drive into the second wall to angle youself upwards.

Upsides: Easy vertical height.

Issues: No known places where it could be useful.
