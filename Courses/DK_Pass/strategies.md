### Crowd Skip (or Wrench Skip? Ethan? I don't fucking know anymore) (by b0ssguy)
Instead of going around the wall and patch of snow, jump onto the rail on the wall and ride it around the turn. 

1. Start a Charge Jump and release it into the pole. 
2. Use the upwards momentum to ride the rail around the wall. 
3. Jump off after the turn to start the Tree Shortcut

Issues: That god damn wrench, all my homes hate wrench

**Alt route:**
1. Jump off and ride the inner wall of the course.
2. Wall Jump and maneuver towards the light pole. 
3. Spam left air tricks to realign towards the Tree Shortcut. If it's not enough, throw in a drift as well. 

Issues: Unfavorable angle after the Pole Trick
