### Crowd Skip/Pole Jump Skip (by b0ssguy)
Instead of going around the wall and patch of snow, jump onto the rail on the wall and ride it around the turn. 

**Path 1:** (Crowd Skip)

1. Start a Charge Jump and release it into the leftmost pole. 
2. Use the upwards momentum to ride the rail around the wall. 
3. Jump off after the turn to start the Tree Shortcut.

Upsides: Skips going around the turn.

Issues: That god damn wrench, all my homes hate wrench

**Path 2:** (Pole Jump Skip)

Instead of going around the wall and patch of snow, use a Wall Ride chained into a Pole Jump to skip the snow patch entirely.

1. Jump off and ride the inner wall of the course.
2. Wall Jump and maneuver towards the light pole. 
3. Spam left air tricks to realign towards the Tree Shortcut. If it's not enough, throw in a drift as well. 

Upsides: Skips going around the turn.

Issues: Slower than using the rail. Unfavorable angle upon landing.
