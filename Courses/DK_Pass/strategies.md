## CONFIRMED AND UTILISED
### Beginning Turnskip (by Xurai) 
Instead of taking the pole shortcut and driving around the turn, Use a CJ to skip the turn entirely. 

1. Before the second coin, start a left drift and release MT. 
2. Start a CJ and release it onto the mesh wall. 
3. Wall Ride all the way up and Wall Jump early. 
4. Spam Left Air Tricks to realign. 
5. (optional) When landing, spam hops to gain speed on the off-road. Don't know if it's faster tho. 

Upsides: saves a lot of time going around the turn. 

Issues: Lands you in offroad, so movement after is hard. Currently has only ever been done on a high handling and low speed combo, which loses time in the long run.

## CONFIRMED, NOT YET UTILISED
### Crowd Skip/Pole Jump Skip (by b0ssguy)
Instead of going around the wall and patch of snow, jump onto the rail on the wall and ride it around the turn. 

**Path 1:** (Crowd Skip)

1. Start a Charge Jump and release it into the leftmost pole. 
2. Use the upwards momentum to ride the rail around the wall. 
3. Jump off after the turn to start the Tree Shortcut.

Upsides: Skips going around the turn.

Issues: That god damn wrench, all my homes hate wrench

**Path 2:** (Pole Jump Skip)

Instead of going around the wall and patch of snow, use a Wall Ride chained into a Pole Jump to skip the snow patch entirely.

1. Jump off and ride the inner wall of the course.
2. Wall Jump and maneuver towards the light pole. 
3. Spam left air tricks to realign towards the Tree Shortcut. If it's not enough, throw in a drift as well. 

Upsides: Skips going around the turn.

Issues: Slower than using the rail. Unfavorable angle upon landing.

### Ending Nisc (by K1ngGr33n) 
Instead of going down the path and shroom ING around the turn, drive on the tribune around the crowd to skip the off-road. 

1. Drive off the boost panel low and trick off the small ramp. Aim towards the right wall. 
2. Use a Left Air Trick to realign, then land on the wall without grinding the rail. 
3. Hop and drift around the turn, making sure to go as absolutely wide as possible. Hopping is required as you won't have enough space otherwise. 

**Ext. Path (theoretical):**

4. Release a MT at the end and drive on the metal for a while. 
5. Trick off the metal onto the wall and ride it. 
6. Wall Jump towards the Pillar of the finish line. Land on it early to get a boost, then realign with a Left Air Trick. 

Upsides: Saves a shroom for use elsewhere. Even if it doesn't work out, it's still a time save, as it spends less time in the air and less time having to go around the turn. 

Issues: REALLY HARD. Lakitu is very strict around that edge, you have to go incredibly wide to not get grabbed. Hitting the rail kills you run completely, and seeing how you can get on it while drifting, that gives even less space to work with.
