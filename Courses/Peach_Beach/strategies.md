### Lap 2 Alley NISC
Jump over the boxes blocking the box cut in lap 2 to save a shroom.

1. CJ onto the wall before lap 2's alley boxes.
2. Wall Ride off and attach to the right wall inside the cut. You need a good angle before CJing in order to ride the second wall, as you can't air trick inside the alley to attach to it.
3. Wall Jump and perform a rail redirect (WIP: ADD)

Upsides: Saves a shroom for use elsewhere.

Issues: Misses a coin.
