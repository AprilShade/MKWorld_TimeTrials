## CONFIRMED AND UTILISED
### Starting Railing Skip: 
- Utilizing a standalone jump, you hop onto the right rain by the water after collecting the 2 coins, using one forward trick boost, you immediately do a right barrel roll tick onto the blue Railing and do a trick mid air to fall off of the rail into the two coins
-

## CONFIRMED, NOT YET UTILISED
### Ashe Tree Clip:
1. After the Archway, 15 seconds in, aim for the Palm tree beside the snake path.
2. Start and release a CJ into the tree and Pole Jump off it. 
3. Ride the wall and jump off to land on the roof.

Upsides: Saves having to take the turns.

Issues: WIP

Notes: Can be combined with 3 coin rail tricks, or with falling onto one coin and tricking into the other, mitigating the coin loss later on.



### Scissor Lift Skip (by Pluto/Wiz)
Pluto's (Scissor): At lap 3's finish line on lap 1, charge jump at the scissor lift and pole jump off the pole behind it. Wall ride the wall, and jump to the neighboring building's roof.

Wiz's: Instead of CJ'ing, trick off the pavement and ride the wall. Jump off and do some pole jumps.

Pluto recently found another way to do this, by getting a high bounce on the pole after the scissor lift and just before the intersection, and landing on the roof directly.

Pluto (Scissor):

1. Charge jump at the edge of the second scissor lift, sliding past it and bouncing off the pole behind it
2. Land on the rail and immediately jump left
3. Ride the wall until the end and jump off, landing on the next roof

Wiz:

1. Trick off the pavement onto the wall, to the right of the scissor lift.
2. Jump off, and bounce off two separate poles.
3. Land in the upcoming turn.

Pluto (Pole bounce):

1. Charge a charge jump.
2. Land at the base of the pole, to get a high bounce.
3. Land on the roof.

Upsides: Might save time over just driving in a straight line.

Issues: Pluto's scissor lift jump appears to be difficult, and may have been determined to be slower.
Wiz's requires an inconsistent trick. Testing by Pluto determined that this was slower than WR.
Both paths require you to go out of your way to get to the side wall, which itself loses time.
Pluto's pole bounce may be precise.

Note: Depending on which version is determined to be the fastest, the name "Scissor Lift Skip" might not fit anymore.
