## CONFIRMED AND UTILISED

# Starting Railing Skip: 
- Utilizing a standalone jump, you hop onto the right rain by the water after collecting the 2 coins, using one forward trick boost, you immediately do a right barrel roll tick onto the blue Railing and do a trick mid air to fall off of the rail into the two coins

## CONFIRMED, NOT YET UTILISED

# Ashe Tree Clip:
- after the Archway, 15 seconds in, you aim for the Palm tree beside the snake path
- using a standstill trick, you are hitting off the tree on the right side, right tricking onto the wall, and tricking right and then left off the wall onto the roof on the oppisite side.
- can be combined with 3 coin rail tricks, or combined with falling onto one coin and tricking into the other, mitigating the coin loss later on
