## CONFIRMED AND UTILISED
### Starting Railing Skip: 
Instead of drifting around the turn, jump between and off rails to save time.

1. Start a CJ right before collecting the second coin, then release it into the right rail.
2. Before your boost ends, Right Jump onto the next railing. Make sure to land on the slope to get more height.
3. Once you are high enough to not be on the rail, do a Left Air Trick to detatch off it.
4. Collect the 2 coins.
5. (optional, but faster) Trick off the yellow bump.

Upsides: Saves a lot of time and leaves you in a good position to do the double car bounce.

Issues: Hard to do. The timing of the jump and the Air Trick need to be precise to not lose time.

Note: This Trick should also be done at the end of a race, but it instead does a normal forward jump at the second rail into a Pole Jump.

## CONFIRMED, NOT YET UTILISED
### Beginning Tree Skip (by [u/StoryOk3323](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarioKartWorld/comments/1lce9cw/))
Instead of driving through the snake path, use a Pole Jump to get up to the roof.

0. Aim for the Palm tree beside the snake path.
1. Start and release a CJ into the tree and Pole Jump off it. 
2. Ride the wall and jump off to land on the roof.
3. After landing, you have many options, charging a MT or doing an Edge Trick are just some.

Upsides: Saves having to take the turns.

Issues: Bad landing after the trick. Misses 2 coins on the 

Notes: Can be combined with 3 coin rail tricks, or with falling onto one coin and tricking into the other, mitigating the coin loss later on.



### Scissor Lift Skip (by Pluto/Wiz)
Pluto's (Scissor): At lap 3's finish line on lap 1, CJ at the scissor lift and pole jump off the pole behind it. Wall ride the wall, and jump to the neighboring building's roof.

Wiz's: Instead of CJ'ing, trick off the pavement and ride the wall. Jump off and do some pole jumps.

Pluto recently found another way to do this, by getting a high bounce on the pole after the scissor lift and just before the intersection, and landing on the roof directly.

Pluto (Scissor):

1. CJ at the edge of the second scissor lift, sliding past it and bouncing off the pole behind it
2. Land on the rail and immediately jump left
3. Ride the wall until the end and jump off, landing on the next roof

Wiz:

1. Trick off the pavement onto the wall, to the right of the scissor lift.
2. Jump off, and bounce off two separate poles.
3. Land in the upcoming turn.

Pluto (Pole bounce):

1. Start a Charge Jump.
2. Land at the base of the pole, to get a high bounce.
3. Land on the roof.

Upsides: Might save time over just driving in a straight line.

Issues: Pluto's scissor lift jump appears to be difficult, and may have been determined to be slower.
Wiz's requires an inconsistent trick. Testing by Pluto determined that this was slower than WR.
Both paths require you to go out of your way to get to the side wall, which itself loses time.
Pluto's pole bounce may be precise.

Note: Depending on which version is determined to be the fastest, the name "Scissor Lift Skip" might not fit anymore.
