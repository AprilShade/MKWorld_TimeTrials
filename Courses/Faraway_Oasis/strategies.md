### Super Splash (by Prince_Porky)
Use a big jump in order to pass over the grass patch completely.

1. Right Jump off the rail into a Pole Jump.
2. Perform a Left Air Trick and start turning left.
3. Right when getting out of the water, trick, which will send you flying.
4. Spam Left Air Tricks to realign.
5. Once you land, hop left and trick off the fountain. If you have too much speed, hit the wall while facing left to instantly change angles.

Upsides: Skips needing to go onto the wood path. Cuts the turn very tightly.

Issues: Hard to pull off. Right Jump timing is precise and depends on your speed a lot. Not many options for realignment after landing.
