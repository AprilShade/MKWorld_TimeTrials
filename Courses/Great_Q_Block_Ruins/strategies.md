## CONFIRMED AND UTILISED
### Ending Box Cut (by cyndaquil_x on Twitter/X)
After the Ring Cut, maneuver onto the off-road and hit a box on it to skip the turn.

0. Perform the Ring Cut as usual.
1. Instead of returning to the main road, get air and aim for the off-road. 
2. Land early enough to slow down and not break the box (laps 1/2 only)

Issues: You need the perfect amount of airtime to land early, slow down, and stop the box from breaking. Also, there is a random death barrier in the middle of the path, so precise maneuvering is required.

## CONFIRMED, NOT YET UTILISED
### Zaquas Wall (by Zaqua)
After the standart route, instead of drifting along the route as usual, jump down and ride the inner wall of the track to skip the turn.

0. Perform the normal shroom shortcut.
1. Do the left tick early to land back on the road and get a good alignment.
2. Trick off the ramp, then jump down at a very specific spot and angle.
3. Ride the inner wall of the turn, then jump out at the very end.

Issues: This strat is REALLY HARD. Probably too hard for a 3/3. There's also no known footage of getting the rightmost coin on the ramp after the skip, so we will have to account for that.
