### Ending NISC (by Astra or AprilShade i forgot)
Skip the ending lava pool shroomless by launching onto the nearby wall and tricking over it.

0. Before the shortcut at the end, drive normally
1. When landing on the platform, trick off the green rail towards the corner of the wall over the lava. You need to face left enough to not grind the rail instead.
2. Wall Ride and drive off of it without jumping.
3. Spam left air tricks to realign.

Advantage: Saves a shroom to use elsewhere.

Issues: Not grinding on the green rail is tricky, and getting an actually faster attempt is quite difficult.

**Alt. path:**
1. Attatch to the green rail, then instantly left jump. 
2. Spam left air tricks and performa Wall Jump upon hitting the wall.

Advantages: Saves a shroom to use elsewhere.

Issues: Harder than the other path, but faster.
