### Ending NISC (by Astra & AprilShade)
Skip the ending lava pool shroomless with the use of strategic Wall Riding and Jumping.

**Path 1:** (by Astra)

0. Before the shortcut at the end, drive normally
1. When landing on the platform, trick off the green rail towards the corner of the wall over the lava. You need to face left enough to not grind the rail instead.
2. Wall Ride and drive off of it without jumping.
3. Spam left air tricks to realign.

Upsides: Saves a shroom to use elsewhere.

Issues: Not grinding on the green rail is tricky, and getting an actually faster attempt is quite difficult.

**Path 2:** (by AprilShade)

1. Attatch to the green rail, then instantly left jump. 
2. Spam left air tricks and performa Wall Jump upon hitting the wall.

Upsides: Saves a shroom to use elsewhere.

Issues: Harder than the other path, but faster.

**Path 3:** (by AprilShade)

1. On the bottom path near the end, trick onto the wall.
2. Quickly Wall Jump to the left and Wall Ride on the platform. Timing is key to hit the second wall.
3. Ride off the wall without jumping, and start spamming Left Air Tricks. Try to hit it early to be able to cross the lava lake.
4. Wall Jump off the last wall and land back on the road.

Upsides: Saves a shroom to use elsewhere. Is possible from the bottom path, so it's viable for the current route.

Issues: Far more difficult than the other paths.
