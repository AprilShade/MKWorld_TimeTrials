(Note: If you want to submit your own strats, create an issue and select "Strategy Idea")

---
## CONFIRMED AND UTILISED
### Bone Road Cut (by Aprilshade & Zepline) 
On the bone road near the end, Drift/CJ off to the left from the second-to-last brown ramp. 

**Path 1:** (by Zepline)

1. Drift left off the ramp and trick, then land in the off-road. 
2. Take the regular lower road to take the upcoming shortcut. 

Upsides: Faster than normal routes. 

Issues: None.

**Path 2:** (by Aprilshade)

0. Drift wide to the right to get a better angle. 
1. Start a Left CJ and release it off the ramp, then land in the off-road. Land as far out of it as possible to avoid the rock. 
2. Trick onto the right wall and Wall Jump to take the upcoming shortcut. 

Upsides: Seems faster than the first path. 

Issues: You might not be able to take the lower road due to alignment, though this doesn't seem to matter much. 

Issues (Both): Since both strats take the bottom path, Ending NISC 2 is impossible. 

Notes: Zepline was the first to use Path 1 in a WR, while Andremar did it for Path 2.

## CONFIRMED, NOT YET UTILISED
### Ending NISC (by Astra & AprilShade)
Skip the ending lava pool shroomless with the use of strategic Wall Riding and Jumping.

**Path 1:** (by Astra)

0. Before the shortcut at the end, drive normally
1. When landing on the platform, trick off the green rail towards the corner of the wall over the lava. You need to face left enough to not grind the rail instead.
2. Wall Ride and drive off of it without jumping.
3. Spam left air tricks to realign.

Upsides: Saves a shroom to use elsewhere.

Issues: Not grinding on the green rail is tricky, and getting an actually faster attempt is quite difficult.

**Path 2:** (by AprilShade)

1. Attatch to the green rail, then instantly left jump. 
2. Spam left air tricks and performa Wall Jump upon hitting the wall.

Upsides: Saves a shroom to use elsewhere.

Issues: Harder than the other path, but faster.

**Path 3:** (by AprilShade)

1. On the bottom path near the end, trick onto the wall.
2. Quickly Wall Jump to the left and Wall Ride on the platform. Timing is key to hit the second wall.
3. Ride off the wall without jumping, and start spamming Left Air Tricks. Try to hit it early to be able to cross the lava lake.
4. Wall Jump off the last wall and land back on the road.

Upsides: Saves a shroom to use elsewhere. Is possible from the bottom path, so it's viable for the current route.

Issues: Far more difficult than the other paths.
