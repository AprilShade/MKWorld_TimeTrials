### Beginning NISC (by AprilShade)
Release a CJ in the beginning off-road spot, and use it to jump onto the right wall and railing.

1. Release a CJ in the off-road at the beginning, where the shroom is normally used.
2. Ride the wall upward onto the railing.

Upsides: Saves a shroom. Could maybe be faster than going around, if done well.

Issues: Currently, it seems very slow.

Notes: This has not been tested enough to see if it could compare with current strats.
