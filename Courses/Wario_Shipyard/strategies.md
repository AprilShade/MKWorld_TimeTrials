## CONFIRMED AND UTILISED
### Rail Shortcut (by AprilShade, Pluto, Prince Porky and Zaqua)
After the tunnel near the start, instead of going right across the water, take the rail on the left rock.

1. After the tunnel, the goal is to get onto the white rail to the left. This can be done with a trick off the waves (depending on the current wave cycle), or a CJ. The trick method gives much more speed.
2. Jump left off the end of the rail, and angle/move to trick off the left tree.
3. When landing, land near the left shipwreck and sand patch, and do one of the following:
a. Land on the red water barrier or the water near it, and drive on the ship itself. The barrier is trickable.
b. Land in the water, and bounce up to wall ride on the ship.
c. Land in the water and shroom, bounce up to hit the pole, and travel over the sand to land in the ship.
d. You could also stay on the water path, if needed.

Upsides: Faster than simply going around the sand.

Issues: The faster entry method (tricking) relies heavily on the position of the waves. Without a good cycle, you'd need to use the slower charge jump method.
If you do this lap one, you'd miss three coins.

Note: The fastest way hasn't been found yet, more testing is needed.

### Ship Rail Shortcut
Instead of going into the left part of the ship, go into the right part and use a CJ to ride the rail on top of the wall. 

0. Perform the Rail Shortcut, but instead maneuver towards the right entrance. 
1. Start a left drift (above the sand patch) and release MT into the entrance. Aim for the left of the entrance. 

**Path 1:**

2. Start a CJ and hit the left wall to realign yourself. 
3. Release a Front CJ on the right of the ramp, then Wall Ride upwards. 
4. Grind on the rail above the wall. 

Upsides: Easier method. 

Issues: Hitting the wall might still not give a good enough angle for the strat. 

**Path 2:**

2. Start a Right Drift to slide across the floor to the left and align yourself to the right.
3. Release the Drift (Drift, not MT) and instantly start a CJ. 
4. Release a Front CJ on the right of the ramp, then Wall Ride upwards. 
5. Grind on the rail above the wall. 

Upsides: Will probably give a better angle. 

Issues: Harder to pull off. 

**Path 3:**

2. Start a Right Drift to slide across the floor to the left and align yourself to the right. Make sure to not slide too close. 
3. Release the Drift (Drift, not MT) and instantly start a CJ. 
4. Hit the wall to cancel all leftwards speed. 
5. Release a Front CJ on the right of the ramp, then Wall Ride upwards. 
6. Grind on the rail above the wall. 

Upsides: Combines both paths. Gives a better angle while also still having breathing room for the drift, since you don't need to avoid the left wall. 

Issues: Probably the hardest of them all. Idk tho. 

Note: Currently, it is unknown which of the paths is more consistent/likely to work. You can also perform path 1 without hitting the wall, but it's far too unreliable.
