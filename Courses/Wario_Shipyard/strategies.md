## CONFIRMED AND UTILISED
### Beginning Tree Jump (by Melontoad (shroom) and RescaP (NISC))
At the start of Wario Shipyard, charge jump off of the boost ramp to get enough height to trick of the right tree.

1. Charge jump on the first boost ramp and aim for the right-side tree.
2. Trick off the tree and either go around the hill for shroomless or land on top with a shroom.
3. If done with a shroom, you can either shroom off toward the ramp below, or shroom onto the railing to the right.

Upsides: Shroomless saves a shroom. Shroom methods appear faster than current.

Issues: None.



### Rail Shortcut (by AprilShade, Pluto, Prince Porky and Zaqua)
After the tunnel near the start, instead of going right across the water, take the rail on the left rock.

1. After the tunnel, the goal is to get onto the white rail to the left. This can be done with a trick off the waves (depending on the current wave cycle), or a CJ. The trick method gives much more speed.
2. Jump left off the end of the rail, and angle/move to trick off the left tree.
3. When landing, land near the left shipwreck and sand patch, and do one of the following:
a. Land on the red water barrier or the water near it, and drive on the ship itself. The barrier is trickable.
b. Land in the water, and bounce up to wall ride on the ship.
c. Land in the water and shroom, bounce up to hit the pole, and travel over the sand to land in the ship.
d. You could also stay on the water path, if needed.

Upsides: Faster than simply going around the sand.

Issues: The faster entry method (tricking) relies heavily on the position of the waves. Without a good cycle, you'd need to use the slower charge jump method.
If you do this lap one, you'd miss three coins.

Note: The fastest way hasn't been found yet, more testing is needed.

## CONFIRMED, BUT OBSOLETE
### Coin Path Route (by AprilShade)
After the three coins on the stone after the tunnel, trick onto the right wall and land on the platform. From there, there are a variety of options.

1. After the three coins, trick onto the right wall.
2. Land on the platform and trick off of it.
3. From there, you can do one of the following:
    a. Ride the left rail, and bounce off one of the wood poles after if desired. This option seems to be the fasted.
    b. Ride the right rail.
    c. Wall ride the ship.
    d. Land in the water.

Upsides: Allows you to stay away from enemies in VS race.

Issues: Slower by about 0.4 per lap.



### Right-side Parkour (by AprilShade)
After the tunnel, Wall Jump and parkour to reach the high-up railing.

1. After the tunnel, ride the wall on the right side.
2. Wall Jump onto the outcropped wall and Wall Jump again.
3. Bounce off the nearby tree.
4. If you have a good alignment, you'll be able to air trick onto (or over) the railing on the right.

Upsides: None.

Issues: It's difficult, inconsistent, and slow.
You often fail to get a wall jump on step two, leaving you in a state that can't drift, trick, or wall ride.
You can easily miss the tree in step three.
You can easily not get close enough to land on the rail in step four.

Notes: If you don't perform it perfectly, you can sometimes convert it into the other wall-ride strategy in the same area.
This has not been confirmed with the WR combo.

When using the demonstrated combo, there are some features that can be used somewhat as indicators:

1. The patch of grass for the wall ride in step one
2. The higher tree for the wall jump that leads into step two

## NOT YET CONFIRMED
### Ship Rail Shortcut
Instead of going into the left part of the ship, go into the right part and use a CJ to ride the rail on top of the wall. 

0. Perform the Rail Shortcut, but instead maneuver towards the right entrance. 
1. Start a left drift (above the sand patch) and release MT into the entrance. Aim for the left of the entrance. 

**Path 1:**

2. Start a CJ and hit the left wall to realign yourself. 
3. Release a Front CJ on the right of the ramp, then Wall Ride upwards. 
4. Grind on the rail above the wall. 

Upsides: Easier method. 

Issues: Hitting the wall might still not give a good enough angle for the strat. 

**Path 2:**

2. Start a Right Drift to slide across the floor to the left and align yourself to the right.
3. Release the Drift (Drift, not MT) and instantly start a CJ. 
4. Release a Front CJ on the right of the ramp, then Wall Ride upwards. 
5. Grind on the rail above the wall. 

Upsides: Will probably give a better angle. 

Issues: Harder to pull off. 

**Path 3:**

2. Start a Right Drift to slide across the floor to the left and align yourself to the right. Make sure to not slide too close. 
3. Release the Drift (Drift, not MT) and instantly start a CJ. 
4. Hit the wall to cancel all leftwards speed. 
5. Release a Front CJ on the right of the ramp, then Wall Ride upwards. 
6. Grind on the rail above the wall. 

Upsides: Combines both paths. Gives a better angle while also still having breathing room for the drift, since you don't need to avoid the left wall. 

Issues: Probably the hardest of them all. Idk tho. 

Note: Currently, it is unknown which of the paths is more consistent/likely to work. You can also perform path 1 without hitting the wall, but it's far too unreliable.
