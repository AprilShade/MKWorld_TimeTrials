## CONFIRMED AND UTILISED
### Rail Shortcut (by AprilShade, Pluto, Prince Porky and Zaqua)
After the tunnel near the start, instead of going right across the water, take the rail on the left rock.

1. After the tunnel, the goal is to get onto the white rail to the left. This can be done with a trick off the waves (depending on the current wave cycle), or a CJ. The trick method gives much more speed.
2. Jump left off the end of the rail, and angle/move to trick off the left tree.
3. When landing, land near the left shipwreck and sand patch, and do one of the following:
a. Land on the red water barrier or the water near it, and drive on the ship itself. The barrier is trickable.
b. Land in the water, and bounce up to wall ride on the ship.
c. Land in the water and shroom, bounce up to hit the pole, and travel over the sand to land in the ship.
d. You could also stay on the water path, if needed.

Upsides: Faster than simply going around the sand.

Issues: The faster entry method (tricking) relies heavily on the position of the waves. Without a good cycle, you'd need to use the slower charge jump method.
If you do this lap one, you'd miss three coins.

Note: The fastest way hasn't been found yet, more testing is needed.
