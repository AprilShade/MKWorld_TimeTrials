**What course is your idea for?**
Add all course that your idea applies to. If you don't know yet, write "N/A".

**Who found the strategy?**
If there are multiple people, add all of them. (Also add them if they found a different approach, but didn’t contribute to the main strategy.)

**Describe the Strategy Idea you are submitting.**
A clear and concise description of what you have in mind.

**Describe step-by-step how to do the strategy**
Do this in a 1. 2. 3. list. Use 0. for an action that has to be taken before the strategy is applied. If you're unsure, leave this spot blank, and we will try to do it for you (ONLY if you have footage). If there are multiple ways to approach the strategy, add all of them, including the author(s) of each. *DO NOT open multiple issues for different routes!*

**Footage of your proposed strategy (recommended)**
Video proof, Screenshots with routes drawn into them, spliced footage, footage of the strat on other stages... anything is allowed!

**Advantages and/or Upsides your strategy has**
What about your strategy is better than the current WR route? If you’re unsure or there is nothing to mention, type "None". *THIS IS IMPORTANT!*

**Issues and/or Downsides your strategy has**
What issues does your strategy have (like missing coins, having a bad alignment afterwards etc.)? If you’re unsure or there is nothing to mention, type "None". *THIS IS IMPORTANT!*

**Additional notes (optional)**
Add any other notes about your strategy idea here.
