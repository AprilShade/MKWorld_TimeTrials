Name pending.

By wall riding onto a rail, and dismounting before your kart can straightens out, your kart will travel in an arc and fall slower than normal. How tight this arc is depends on how quickly you jumped off from the rail â€” a quicker jump will result in a wider arc.

This does not seem possible with all rails/walls; while not fully understood, it may only be possible with round pipe rails, and not flat rails.
This is known to be possible on Wario Stadium and Crown City, but currently only has practical use on the latter.
