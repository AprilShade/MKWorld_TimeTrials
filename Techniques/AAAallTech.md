### Drifting
Hold R/ZR to turn sharper. Charges a mini-turbo (MT), which has 3 levels (normal, super (SMT), and ultra (UMT)). How fast it charges depends on how sharp you are turning.

### Charge Jump (CJ)
Hold R/ZR without inputting a direction. Can be aimed to the side, which will get less air, or forwards, which will make you jump higher.

###Drifting Charge Jump

### Tricking
Press R/ZR when going off a platform (or in the air) to trick and get a boost when landing. Tricks done in the air are called Air Tricks. Tricks can be normal, left, right, forwards, and backwards tricks (normal, forwards and backwards are currently the same.) 

### Tricking: Air Trick
Tricks done in the air are called Air Tricks. They give a smaller boost than regular tricks. When done while gliding, you can quickly move left or right, or gain or lose height, based on the direction of Trick you do. Tricks while gliding do not give any speed boost.

### Tricking: Edge Tricks
Tricks done at the edge of the road, often a raised platform and at a turn, are called Edge Tricks. It's usually only called an Edge Trick if you can remain on the road after the Trick.

### Tricking: Phantom Tricks
A Trick that is performed with seemingly no ledge or air time is often called a Phantom Trick. While they can be consistent, the timing, angle, and positioning can be extremely precise.

### Water Driving
Not really a technique, but it is new to this game. You can now drive on water, which gives better handling for all turning, at the cost of speed. You can also trick on waves on the water, or when coming out of it after a jump. 

### Wall Riding
Trick/CJ onto a wall to ride it. How high you go depends on your angle, the more parallel you are, the lower you will go. You can also perform a Wall Jump, which acts like a trick.

### Wall Jump
Tricking while wall riding will propel you away from the wall, and give a mini-turbo upon landing.

### Rail Grinding
Drive/CJ onto a rail to grind it. The rail acts like a magnet, letting you turn very sharp. A jump can be performed to the side or forwards, which acts like a CJ with a longer boost.

### Pole Jump
Trick/CJ into a pole to jump off it. This gives you an upward boost while retaining your speed. A lot of things are considered poles, like pipes or pillars.

### Super Pole Jump
Name pending. By Pole Jumping at the base of a pole, you can get far more height than usual, though you lose a lot of horizontal speed.

### Super Bounce
Release a drift/mini-turbo just before hitting a bouncy surface for more speed.

### Floaty Rail Dismount
Name pending. Wall riding onto a rail and jumping off of it early causees you to fall slowly and have an unusual curved momentum. This does not work with all rails.
