# Techniques List

(Note: for an in-depth overview of each tech, check out that tech's document.)

---
### Drifting
Hold R/ZR to turn sharper. Charges a mini turbo (MT), which has 3 levels (normal, super, and ultra). How fast it charges depends on how sharp you are turning.

### Charge Jump (CJ)
Hold R/ZR without inputting a direction. Can be aimed to the side, which will get less air, or forwards, which will make you jump higher.

### Tricking
Press R/ZR when going off a platform (or in the air) to trick and get a boost when landing. Tricks done in the air are called Air Tricks. Tricks can be normal, left, right, forwards, and backwards tricks (normal, forwards and backwards are currently the same.) 

### Water Driving
Not really a technique, but it is new to this game. You can now drive on water, which gives better handling for all turning, at the cost of speed. You can also trick on waves on the water, or when coming out of it after a jump. 

### Wall Riding
Trick/CJ onto a wall to ride it. How high you go depends on your angle, the more parallel you are, the lower you will go. You can also perform a Wall Jump, which acts like a trick.

### Rail Grinding
Drive/CJ onto a rail to grind it. The rail acts like a magnet, letting you turn very sharp. A jump can be performed to the side or forwards, which acts like a CJ with a longer boost.

### Pole Jump
Trick/CJ into a pole to jump off it. This gives you an upward boost while retaining your speed. A lot of things are considered poles, like pipes or pillars.
