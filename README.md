# How this repo works

There are multiple folders containing important things for time trials. Here's what they are all for:

## Courses: 
This folder is for information specific to courses. That includes strategies and routes.

If you want to **submit a strategy**, create an issue and choose "Strategy Idea".

## Techniques:
This folder contains descriptions of all the different tech used throughout time trials. 

There is one document for all tech, and one for each that goes into more detail about it.

## Resources:
This folder contains resources like character/vehicle stats.
